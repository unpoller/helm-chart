    description: 'A Helm chart for unpoller, a unifi prometheus exporter. This chart
      helps deploy Unpoller (unifi metrics exporter) in kubernetes clusters.  It crates
      a Deployment to run the unpoller container, confiuration is stored in a ConfigMap
      and mounted in the container. It supports integration with Prometheus operator,
      so a PodMonitor is created that will scrape the Deployment for the metrics.
      Optionally, it can deploy automatically the dashboards into a Grafana instance
      through the integration with GrafanaOperator: * Creates a Grafana CR with the
      credentials provided (or reuses existing Grafana object) * Creates a Dashboard
      instance for all the unpoller provided charts.  See further documentation in
      how to install unpoller in Kubernetes in http://unpoller.github.io/helm-chart   **Note**:
      *This is a best effort to keep this chart working for kubernetes.* '
